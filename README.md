  I started this project mid january after classes finished, as a way to take my mind of studying for finals. Initially I created a software renderer to render a spinning cube in terminal, which only used the CPU. I thought it looked like a unique art style to make a full game engine in, and was inspired by "Code-It-Yourself! First Person Shooter (Quick and Simple C++)" by javid9X on YouTube. After learning the basics of openGL, I created a simple rendering engine, the details of which I will put in the specifications below. I hid the window output from openGL, stored all the pixels in an array, and changed them to characters 1 by 1, depending on the sum of the red green and blue channels from the pixel. After this I made my own .obj importer to make it possible to import 3D models I downloaded of the internet. After this I began working on the physics engine, but quickly came to the conclusionI had no idea how to implement rigid bodie physics, since all I had is a simple mechanics course from first year, and at the time I was planning on taking advanced mechanics in 3rd year. This forced me to seek resources online, where I quickly came to the realization that there is a lot more to basic rigid bodie physics simulation than I initially expected. I spent the next couple weeks reading and studying "Game Physics Engine Development" by Ian Millington, as well as some other online resources, from which I began getting a grasp on what I had to do to accomplish just a fraction of what I was initially intending.


  has to be triangles


if I were to do it again:
